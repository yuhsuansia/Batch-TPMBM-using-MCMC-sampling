# Batch-TPMBM-using-MCMC-sampling
This repository contains the Matlab code of a batch implementation of the trajectory Poisson Multi-Bernoulli mixture multi-object tracker using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

The implementation is described in 

Y. Xia, Á. F. García-Fernández, and L. Svensson, "Markov chain monte carlo multi-scan data association for sets of trajectories," in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 2024, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03423.

The trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter is described in

K. Granström, L. Svensson, Y. Xia, J. Williams, Á. F. García-Fernández, "Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture trackers: Continuity through random finite sets of trajectories," in 2018 21st International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION) 2022, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05131 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08718.

The tracking performance is evaluated using the trajectory generalised optimal subpattern-assignment (TGOSPA) metric, presented in
